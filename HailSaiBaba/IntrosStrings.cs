Bayadevi In a village called Ladwanti, near the town of Kalyan, Maharashtra. Of all three sons and a daughter, Manik was the middle who was more close to the trees, the breeze, the birds and the flowers than regular child life. His Leelas soon appear to begin.<p>\r\n\r\nOnce one of his playmates, Govinda had passed away after suffering from fever for a few days. Manik assured Govinda’s mother to stop grieving he will bring her son alive. Sure enough, when Govinda’s mother called out to him to go out and play with Manik, he arose as if out of a deep slumber.\r\n\r\n</p>On another occasion, Bheemabai wife of Apparao Arab, a General in the army of the Nizam of Hyderabad, was travelling to visit Manik to seek his blessings for progeny. On her way she noticed some boys beating up one boy for eight cowries (shells) that he owed the other boys. Bheemabai gave him the eight cowries. Thus released, the boy said, You are given eight sons. You may go!\r\n\r\nWhen Bheemabai reached Manik’s home and she learnt that the boy whom she had rescued on her way was Manik. Manik said, “I have already given you what you seek. Go in peace!” Satisfied Bheemabai left for Hyderabad and in the years to come, she was blessed with eight sons and remained eternally grateful to Manik to the end of her life. This was Manik’s divine insight that Bheemabai sought children and he promised eight sons for eight cowries before she pleaded him.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the formal education needed for making one fit for normal worldly life, was obviously not required for Manik. For, it appeared that he would rather wander through the woods gathering wisdom right from Nature than information from the class room. On being reprimanded by his uncle, he left his house and wandered in different Forests, Caves and sacred places. As his Leelas were spreading Many devotees approached him for his benediction. As the fame of Shri Manik Prabhu spread far and wide, people flocked to have his Darshan and seek succour from worldly troubles. Invariably, people need quick results. They have neither the patience to pray nor the willingness to wait for the result. For some, the very sight of a holy person brings solace; but there are others who desire to have assured remedies.\r\n\r\nShri Prabhu sat under the Audumbara tree in ecstatic meditation, which special to Sri Datta Sampradaya. It is the favourite tree of Sri Dattatreya and it is believed that he always dwells thereunder. It is the symbol of deliverance. Since then, with the grace of Sri Narasimha, the Audumbara tree became the Kalpvrisksha, shedding illumination and wisdom. Therefore, it came to pass that one who does penance sitting thereunder is freed from the agony of the Samsara.\r\n\r\nShri Prabhu being an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya had a special affinity for the Audumbara tree. The incident of the Bilva trees and the ecstatic meditation that he experienced under the Audumbara tree both must have had a special symbolism for him that led him to choose that site as his permanent abode for the remaining years of his temporal life. Thus was established what is today known as the village of MANIKNAGAR. Prabhu prophesied that his form will again incarnate in Akkalkot. <p>Sadguru Manikya Prabhu, on an appointed day in the Month of December, 1865, decided to enter a sub-terrain place and sat therein in meditation along with a copy of \"Sree Guru Charitra\" and attained Maha Samadhi.</p>");

He stayed in Akkalkot for close to twenty two years. Like all other Datta avatars, his parentage, name, native place, etc., remain obscure to this day. There was an incident when a devotee posed him a question about his life and Shri Swami Samarth indicated that he is the origin of the Banyan tree (Vata- Vriksha) whose prop roots represent other saints, his disciples and other Datta incarnations.

Many a devotee connected with places sacred to Dattatreya such as Ganagapur, Narsoba Wadi got mysterious calls from their deity to go to the Swami at Akkalkot for his blessings. By his grace he brought about a fundamental change in the lives of many (Hridaya Parivartan) by influencing their minds and hearts to get over their weaknesses and blemishes.

He was revered by both his Muslim and Hindu devotees, and during, as well as after, his life on earth it remained uncertain if he was a Muslim or Hindu himself. Sai Baba stressed the importance of surrender to the guidance of the true Sadguru or Murshad, who, having gone the path to divine consciousness himself, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.\r\n\r\nNo verifiable information is given regarding Sai Baba's real name, place or time of birth. When asked about his past, he often gave elusive responses. The name \"Sai\" was given to him upon his arrival at Shirdi, by Mahalsapati, a local temple priest. Sai Baba arrived at the village of Shirdi in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra, at about 16 years old. He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a neem tree and meditating while sitting in an asana. The people of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat or cold.<p>Sai Baba initially stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year, and returned permanently around 1858.\r\n\r\nThe Ahimsa aspect of Jainism, the renunciation aspect of Buddhism, the Dharmic aspect of Lord Rama the Nishkama-Karma aspect of Lord Krishna, the universal-love aspect of Jesus, the universalbrotherhood aspect of Islam-all are found harmoniously blended in Sai Nath's way of life.</p> Sai Baba's millions of disciples and devotees believe that he performed many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialisation, exorcisms, making the river Yamuna, entering a state of Samadhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (khanda yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, after death rising on third day, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in a miraculous way. He also gave Darshan (vision) to people in the form of Rama, Krishna, Vithoba and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.\r\n\r\nAccording to his followers he appeared to them in dreams even after he left his body and gave them advice.<p> His devotees have documented many stories. Sai Baba converted an old dilapidated Mosque as his residence and had named it as 'Dwarakamai' and in this unique place, the essence of all the principal creeds were united and the common worship of the universal god brought home to each and all in a unique and loving manner. The presence of Dhuni (sacred fire) was a temple to the Hindus and the Parsees, the nimbaru (niche) on the western wall made it look like a mosque and to the Christian it was a church where the bells announce prayers.
